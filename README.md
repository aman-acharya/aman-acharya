## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ayush Acharya

### Aspiring Data Analyst | Data Scientist | AI Enthusiast

I'm currently on a journey to master data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. With a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Advanced Excel, Power BI, and PostgreSQL, I'm consistently building my expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. I have hands-on experience with key Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit, and Langchain.

### ðŸ’¼ Experience

I completed a 3-month **Data Analysis Certification** at [Data Profession Academy](https://dataprofessionacademy.com/), where I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and model building. Following this, I interned at [WryteAI](https://wryteai.com/landing), an Australian-based AI startup, where I contributed to various data-driven projects and honed my skills in AI tools and techniques.

### ðŸš€ Projects

- [Movie Recommender App](https://best-movie-recommender.streamlit.app/): A personalized movie recommender system.

### ðŸ§  Interests

I am passionate about:
- Building AI models
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Generative AI
